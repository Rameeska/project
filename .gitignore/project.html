With the Cafe and Fast-food Retail Entrepreneur (CFRE) program, LASSI SHOP is looking to revolutionize successful entrepreneurship
 in the food retail industry. The dream is to partner with individuals who are passionate and driven to join our CFRE program and be
 a part of a team that aims to offer Indian consumers fresh, healthy and hygienic beverages as a superior alternative to fizzy drinks
 invading the country. LASSI SHOP has given us a platform to shake the whole Indian F&B retail market, as it has a huge potential thus
 making our growth rate phenomenal. Our chain gives us the opportunity to stretch our imaginations to the furthest thus racing away to
 be the front runners in this segment of business across the city which is the benchmark when it comes to innovation.<p>

This street side eatery has a wide variety of refreshing juices, mocktails, smoothies, shakes and ofcourse lassis. This outlet chain 
started around a year ago with two outlets in Koramangala and Frazer town and the rest is history .Our menu is constantly refreshed with 
newinnovative beverages after taking feedback from our patrons. Employed professionals from nearby offices frequently visit our outlets 
to get their daily dose of health in the form of yoghurt and fruits. We are a contemporary concept that seeks to redefine successful food
 retailing in India by offering consumers “Fresh, Healthy, and Tasty “delicacies at an affordable price. At LASSI SHOP we use natural 
 colouring like beetroot and experiment with the quantity to create new colours.Tender coconut and dry fruit are the most popular flavours . 
 Our well trained and friendly staff also gives free samplers (shots) to people throughout the day in an attempt to get feedback.<p>
